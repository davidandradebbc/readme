# David Andrade – Head of Software Engineering – TV, Radio & Music - BBC

## What is this?
This is one of the ways for me to give you context of who I am, what I believe in, what my job is and how all of these things come together day to day.

## About Me / My Job
I’m Portuguese and have been living in the UK for over 8 years now. I love sports (I think it has something to do with improving performance) and I’m a runner, fancy a marathon?

I am a true believer that people can achieve great things, a lot of the time more than they think they can. A great part of my job is enabling others to grow and improve themselves and those around them. This is done in many complex ways but also in many simple ones. Basically, you can expect me to care about everything from the small things like if you don’t have coffee, to the fact that you’ve just had your first child (congrats btw!), and how happy or “sleep depriving” that is for you, or how we can improve our tech stack. We are all people, so you can expect me to treat you with the same respect and attention, regardless of your job title, background or anything else. If you ever feel that I’m not doing so, please tell me! Also, remember that I don’t have a desk in either of our offices. If you see me sitting with your team, that’s because I like to be around. And if I’m sitting at your desk when you arrive in the morning, feel free to “kick me out”.

Another very important part of the job is to make sure that our engineering is up there with the best in the world. In better words, are we holding high standards and do we keep raising them? We are here to provide the best service to our customers, that only happens if we think about them first and build technology that satisfies their needs. And we should totally have some fun while we are it.


## Personal Principles / Values
I value improvement, excellence, team work and "getting things done". I try to hold everyone, myself included, to high standards. But we are all a work in progress, just like the software we create; if I can help you with your development or you have suggestions for me, let’s chat! Also, I believe that we are here to do something special and the opportunities in front of us, to improve our Products, are huge - shall we? Then let’s do it together, we can achieve a lot if we work well as a team.

Other things you should have in mind are that I will do my best to be fully transparent with you, there are things that I may not be able to share straight away for whatever reason but that is what I would like to do. I will have your back, it doesn’t really matter the situation, if you are doing something you believe is the right thing to do and with good intentions, then I will be there for you if it goes wrong. When we disagree, I will tell you in private and I’m sure we can work it out.

## One-on-Ones
If you are in my direct team, I will meet with you every week. These conversations will vary from developing your skills long term, to burning issues we may need to talk about. Regardless of what the conversation is, I always want to know how you are doing and what you want to talk about, please don’t be shy and please tell me. Also, I try to have a lot of informal conversations, grab a coffee or a simple walk around the office. Yes, I sometimes do that annoying thing of sitting next to you just to see how you’re doing (sorry if I interrupt whatever you were doing and feel free to tell me to go away). If you are not in my direct team, and we do have a big team, I will very likely try the more informal approach with the occasional 121 that goes in the diary, but I’m always on slack, phone and  email if you want to get in touch.

## Feedback (how to give & how you give)
I’m very direct and you can always count on me to be honest with you. If I need to give you feedback, I will try to do it in the best possible way but I will do it. It would be great if you could do the same, I really appreciate knowing what I can improve on, feedback is a two way street.

## How to interpret my calendar
Yes, it will very likely look that there isn’t much time but that is not entirely true. Other than 121s that I always try to stick to, if you have an issue or want to chat, I will always make the time.

## Summary
I believe we can do great things as a team (and individuals too) so expect me to push us to. I will always make time for you and care about your wellbeing, development, etc – “care about you” basically.

You will see me questioning things and asking “how can we do it better?” quite a bit. Also, I see team as everyone so don’t find it strange that I want to know about you, your team and everyone around.
